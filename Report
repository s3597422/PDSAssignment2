PDSAssingment2 - Report DRAFT

Introduction:


Methodology:

 - data retrieval
 Yeast dataset was loaded and checked against cvs file visually and by number or rows/lines. 
 Value_counts was used to check target column, and discrepancy was found with documentation values which were found to include an error.
 Null values were confirmed to be 0. 
 TO DO: Sanity check -> I need to understand reports to make sense of numerical values in each column.
 Split data set into data and target sets.
 
 A for loop was used to get a quick idea of distribution of each feature. 
 A scatter matrix was used to look for any strong relationships between columns.
 TO DO - Choose which graphs to focus on.
 TO DO - Format these graphs with labels and appropriate colour.
 TO DO - Explore hypothesis and relationships between pairs of columns

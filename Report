PDSAssingment2 - Report DRAFT

Introduction:


Methodology:

 - data retrieval
 Yeast dataset was loaded and checked against cvs file visually and by number or rows/lines. 
 Value_counts was used to check target column, and discrepancy was found with documentation values which were found to include an error.
 Null values were confirmed to be 0. 
 TO DO: Sanity check -> I need to understand reports to make sense of numerical values in each column.
 TO DO: Split data set into data and target sets
